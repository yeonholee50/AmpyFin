# 🌟 AmpyFin Trading Bot

## 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to **AmpyFin**, an advanced AI-powered trading bot designed for the NASDAQ-100. Imagine having expert traders working for you 24/7—AmpyFin makes this a reality.

## 📊 AmpyFin’s Data Collection Power

### 🔍 Data Sources

- **Financial Modeling Prep API**: Retrieves NASDAQ-100 tickers to gain crucial market insights.
- **Polygon API**: Monitors real-time market conditions, ensuring that the bot acts based on the most current data.

### 💾 Data Storage

All data and trading logs are securely stored in **MongoDB**, allowing fast access to historical trading information and supporting in-depth analysis.

### 🤖 Machine Learning at Work

At the core of AmpyFin are diverse algorithms optimized for different market conditions. Rather than relying on a single strategy or multiple strategies, AmpyFin relies on a ranked ensemble learning system that dynamically ranks each strategy and gives more influence in the final decision to strategies with better performance.

### 📈 Trading Strategies

Some of the strategies AmpyFin employs include:

- **📊 Mean Reversion**: Predicts asset prices will return to their historical average.
- **📈 Momentum**: Capitalizes on prevailing market trends.
- **💱 Arbitrage**: Identifies and exploits price discrepancies between related assets.
- **🧠 AI-Driven Custom Strategies**: Continuously refined through machine learning for enhanced performance.

These strategies work collaboratively, ensuring AmpyFin is always prepared for changing market dynamics.

### 🔗 How Dynamic Ranking Works

Managing multiple algorithms is simplified with AmpyFin’s dynamic ranking system, which ranks each algorithm based on performance.

#### 🏆 Ranking System

Each strategy starts with a base score of 0 and a mock balance of $50,000. The system evaluates their performance and assigns a weight based on the following function:

$$
\left( \frac{e^e}{e^2} - 1 \right)^{2i}
$$

Where \(i\) is the strategy's rank. Please keep in mind that the strategy's rank is inverse of its performance. So a strategy ranked 132 is actually performing the best while strategy ranked 1 is performing the worst currently.

#### ⏳ Time Delta Coefficient

This ensures that strategies with better recent performance have a greater influence on decision-making while maintaining balance by also accounting for old performance as well.

### 💡 Benefits of Dynamic Ranking

- **📉 Quickly adapts to changing market conditions.**
- **📊 Prioritizes high-performing algorithms.**
- **⚖️ Balances risk while maximizing potential returns.**

👉 [Ta-Lib Python Easy Installation](https://github.com/cgohlke/talib-build/releases)

### 3️⃣ Configuration

1. **Create `config.py`**:
   - Copy `config_template.py` to `config.py` and enter your API keys and MongoDB credentials.
    ```python
    POLYGON_API_KEY = "your_polygon_api_key"
    FINANCIAL_PREP_API_KEY = "your_fmp_api_key"
    MONGO_DB_USER = "your_mongo_user"
    MONGO_DB_PASS = "your_mongo_password"
    API_KEY = "your_alpaca_api_key"
    API_SECRET = "your_alpaca_secret_key"
    BASE_URL = "https://paper-api.alpaca.markets"
    mongo_url = "your mongo connection string"
    local_mongo_url = "" # local mongo db url if this feature is set up
    ```

### 4️⃣ API Setup

- Polygon API
1. Sign up at [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io/) and get an API key.
2. Add it to `config.py` as `POLYGON_API_KEY`.

- Financial Modeling Prep API
1. Sign up at [Financial Modeling Prep](https://financialmodelingprep.com/) and get an API key.
2. Add it to `config.py` as `FINANCIAL_PREP_API_KEY`.

- Alpaca API
1. Sign up at [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/) and get API keys.
2. Add them to `config.py` as `API_KEY` and `API_SECRET`.

### 5️⃣ Set Up MongoDB

- Sign up for a MongoDB cluster (e.g., via MongoDB Atlas).
- Create a database for stock data storage and replace the `mongo_url` in 'config.py' with your connection string. Make sure to give yourself Network Access.
- Run the setup script `setup.py`:
- After running the mongo setup script, the MongoDB setup for the rest will be completed on the first minute in trading for both ranking and trading.

### 6️⃣ Set Up Local MongoDB (Optional)

Running a local copy of MongoDB can drastically improve runtime performance as the expensive operations are the MongoDB updates.
- To simply run a local MongoDB run the following command `docker-compose --profile offline up mongodb mongo-express ` in the `./train` directory.
- There is also a simple UI which should be available under localhost:8081
- Create a database for stock data storage and replace the `local_mongo_url` in 'config.py' with your connection string (e.g. "mongodb://admin:password@localhost").
- Run the setup script `setup.py` which will setup both local and remote mongodb.
- After running the mongo setup script, the MongoDB setup for the rest will be completed on the first minute in trading for both ranking and trading.

## Training

To get some meaningfull trades the weights of the different trading strategies need to the trained.
There are multiple options to do this.

### 1. Live Training
   First and easiest option would be to run the ranking client on live data for several days/weeks (min. 2 weeks is recommended)

### 2. Historical Data

   Use historical data to train the ranking client.
      
   For this approach checkout the 'train' directory and adjust the ./train/train_config.py
   By default the ranking_client is trained with 25 days of historical data.
   
   To train the ranking client simply run the train_ranking_client.py script
   - The script will first download historical data and save it as csv
   - It will then run the training based on the downloaded data
   
#### 2.1 Docker
   
You can also use docker to run the training.

`docker-compose up training_client`

#### 2.2 Offline

The training script is design to also work offline if you have some preloaded data available.
You can get some data by simply running train_ranking_client.py and wait until the downloading part is done. The data will be available under ./train/data
##### 2.2.1 Local Python
You can run the train_rankin_client.py in your lokal python environment but you need to have a offline mongodb instance. This can be done via docker:
- You can create a local mongodb instance by running

   `docker-compose up --profile offline`
   This will launch mongodb and also mongo-express. A UI tool for mongodb, which can be accessed via localhost:8081
- To run the training in offline mode you need to modify the `mongo_url` parameter in config.py and set it to `mongodb://admin:password@localhost`
- launch the training script with the following parameters to use the previously downloaded data: `python -m train.train_ranking_client -s ./train/data/symbols.csv -hist ./train/data/historical`

##### 2.2.1 Full Docker
It is also possible to run everything offline in docker (also the train_ranking_client.py) by the following steps:
1. Modify the `mongo_url` parameter in config.py and set it to `mongodb://admin:password@mongodb`
2. In the ./train/Dockerfile.training file add the following parameters to the python command in the last line: `-s ./train/data/symbols.csv -hist ./train/data/historical`
3. Run `docker-compose up`

🐋
### Building and running your application with docker

When you're ready, start your application by running:
`docker compose up --build`.

This starts the trading and ranking container in parallel

If you want to start only a single service, run:
- `docker compose up ranking_client` or
- `docker compose up trading_client`

### Deploying your application to the cloud

First, build your image, e.g.: `docker build -t myapp .`.
If your cloud uses a different CPU architecture than your development
machine (e.g., you are on a Mac M1 and your cloud provider is amd64),
you'll want to build the image for that platform, e.g.:
`docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t myapp .`.

Then, push it to your registry, e.g. `docker push myregistry.com/myapp`.

Consult Docker's [getting started](https://docs.docker.com/go/get-started-sharing/)
docs for more detail on building and pushing.

## ⚡ Usage

To run the bot, execute on two separate terminals:

```bash
python ranking_client.py
python trading_client.py
```

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT

For people looking to do live trading, I suggest training via running ranking_client.py for at least two weeks before running the trading bot altogether. This way, you're running with a client that has been trained to a certain extent (with strategies ranked) and is ready to go. Otherwise, you will most likely be buying random stocks.

## 📑 Logging

- **system.log**: Tracks major events like API errors and MongoDB operations.
- **rank_system.log**: Logs all ranking-related events and updates.
