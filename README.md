# 🌟 AmpyFin Trading System

## 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to **AmpyFin**, an advanced AI-powered trading system designed for the NASDAQ-100. Imagine having expert traders working for you 24/7—AmpyFin makes this a reality.

## 📊 AmpyFin’s Data Collection Power

### 🔍 Data Sources

- **Financial Modeling Prep API**: Retrieves NASDAQ-100 tickers to gain crucial market insights.
- **Polygon API**: Monitors real-time market conditions, ensuring that the system acts based on the most current data.

### 💾 Data Storage

All data and trading logs are securely stored in **MongoDB**, allowing fast access to historical trading information and supporting in-depth analysis.

### 🤖 Machine Learning at Work

At the core of AmpyFin are diverse algorithms optimized for different market conditions. Rather than relying on a single strategy or multiple strategies, AmpyFin relies on a ranked ensemble learning system that dynamically ranks each strategy and gives more influence in the final decision to strategies with better performance.

### 📈 Trading Strategies

Some of the strategies AmpyFin employs include:

- **📊 Mean Reversion**: Predicts asset prices will return to their historical average.
- **📈 Momentum**: Capitalizes on prevailing market trends.
- **💱 Arbitrage**: Identifies and exploits price discrepancies between related assets.
- **🧠 AI-Driven Custom Strategies**: Continuously refined through machine learning for enhanced performance.

These strategies work collaboratively, ensuring AmpyFin is always prepared for changing market dynamics.

### 🔗 How Dynamic Ranking Works

Managing multiple algorithms is simplified with AmpyFin’s dynamic ranking system, which ranks each algorithm based on performance.

#### 🏆 Ranking System

Each strategy starts with a base score of 0 and a mock balance of $50,000. The system evaluates their performance and assigns a weight based on the following function:

$$
\left( \frac{e^e}{e^2} - 1 \right)^{2i}
$$

Where \(i\) is the strategy's rank. Please keep in mind that the strategy's rank is inverse of its performance. So a strategy ranked 132 is actually performing the best while strategy ranked 1 is performing the worst currently.

#### ⏳ Time Delta Coefficient

This ensures that strategies with better recent performance have a greater influence on decision-making while maintaining balance by also accounting for old performance as well.

### 💡 Benefits of Dynamic Ranking

- **📉 Quickly adapts to changing market conditions.**
- **📊 Prioritizes high-performing algorithms.**
- **⚖️ Balances risk while maximizing potential returns.**

## 📂 File Structure and Objectives

### 🕹️ control.py

**Objective**: Designed to allow users to change parameters based on how they would like their version of Ampyfin to trade. Testing and training will also be supported options for both trading and ranking modes.

### 🤝 trading_client.py

**Objective**: Executes trades based on algorithmic decisions.

**Features**:

- Executes trades every 60 seconds by default (adjustable based on user).
- Ensures a minimum spending balance of $15,000 (adjustable based on user) and maintains 30% liquidity (adjustable based on user).
- Logs trades with details like timestamp, stock, and reasoning.

### 🏆 ranking_client.py

**Objective**: Runs the ranking system to evaluate trading strategies.

**Features**:

- Downloads NASDAQ-100 tickers and stores them in MongoDB.
- Updates algorithm scores and rankings every 120 seconds (adjustable based on user).

### 🏋️ TradeSim/main.py

**Objective**: Allows users to train a simulator from scratch, test the simulator, and update their simulator from local to database.

**Features**:

- Training using parameters given by control.py
- Testing using parameters given by control.py
- Option to push trained rank model into MongoDB

### 📜 strategies/*

**Objective**: Defines various trading strategies. Houses strategies like mean reversion, momentum, and arbitrage.

**Features**:

- **trading_strategies_v1.py**: Archived first iteration of AmpyFin used 5 strategies. This file is not supported anymore but is a great reference material
- **trading_strategies_v2.py**:  Archived second gen older strategies being used in the ranking system. Contains 50 strategies with a lot leaning towards momentum.
- **trading_strategies_v2_1.py**: Archived second gen older strategies that complements the older strategies in trading_strategies_v2.py. Houses 10 more strategies. This is where newer strategies will be implemented until it caps at 50 strategies as well.
- **talib_indicators.py**: Contains all the technical indicators used in the strategies. To visit the documentation for each technical indicator, please visit the following link: [Link to TA](https://ta-lib.org/). These indicators were not developed by me, but I have modified their use to fit the needs of AmpyFin. Each indicator is fine tuned with a specific period and historical data is either retrieved from MongoDB cache system or from yfinance.

### 🔧 helper_files/*

**Objective**: Helper Files to help with both trading client and ranking client. Houses functions for retrieving a Mongo Client, getting latest prices, current strategies implemented etc.

**Features**:

- **client_helper.py**: Contains common functions for client operations in both ranking and trading.
- **train_client_helper.py**: Contains utility functions for training and testing.

### 💡 utils/*

**Objective**: Contains utility functions for data processing and analysis as well as other miscellaneous functions. These functions are not necessarily being used currently in trading or ranking but stored for development purposes.

**Features**:

- **check_strategy_scores.py**: Checks the scores of the strategies and prints them out.
- **sell_all.py**: Sells all the stocks in the portfolio.
- **sync_alpaca.py**: Syncs the Alpaca account with the MongoDB account.

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yeonholee50/AmpyFin.git
cd AmpyFin
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

- Run the following command to install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Configuration

1. **Create `config.py`**:
   - Copy `config_template.py` to `config.py` and enter your API keys and MongoDB credentials.
    ```python
    POLYGON_API_KEY = "your_polygon_api_key"
    FINANCIAL_PREP_API_KEY = "your_fmp_api_key"
    MONGO_DB_USER = "your_mongo_user"
    MONGO_DB_PASS = "your_mongo_password"
    API_KEY = "your_alpaca_api_key"
    API_SECRET = "your_alpaca_secret_key"
    BASE_URL = "https://paper-api.alpaca.markets"
    mongo_url = "your mongo connection string"
    ```

### 4️⃣ API Setup

- Polygon API
1. Sign up at [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io/) and get an API key.
2. Add it to `config.py` as `POLYGON_API_KEY`.

- Financial Modeling Prep API
1. Sign up at [Financial Modeling Prep](https://financialmodelingprep.com/) and get an API key.
2. Add it to `config.py` as `FINANCIAL_PREP_API_KEY`.

- Alpaca API
1. Sign up at [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/) and get API keys.
2. Add them to `config.py` as `API_KEY` and `API_SECRET`.

### 5️⃣ Set Up MongoDB

- Sign up for a MongoDB cluster (e.g., via MongoDB Atlas).
- Create a database for stock data storage and replace the `mongo_url` in 'config.py' with your connection string. Make sure to give yourself Network Access.
- Run the setup script `setup.py`:
- After running the mongo setup script, the MongoDB setup for the rest will be completed on the first minute in trading for both ranking and trading.


## ⚡ Usage

- To run the trading and ranking system, execute on two separate terminals:

```bash
python ranking_client.py
python trading_client.py
```

- To train & test:

1. First change the mode in control.py:
```bash
mode = 'train'
```

2. Adjust parameters according to your specifications in control.py

3. Execute on terminal:

```bash
python TradeSim/main.py
```

- To push your model into MongoDB:

1. First change the mode in control.py:
```bash
mode = 'push'
```

2. Make sure you have tested your model and confirm you would like to replace your existing model in MongoDB with your new one.

3. Execute on terminal:

```bash
python TradeSim/main.py
```

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT

For people looking to do live trading, I suggest training via running ranking_client.py for at least two weeks before running the trading system altogether. Or train using TradeSim directory and push changes into MongoDB before executing live trades. This way, you're running with a client that has been trained to a certain extent (with strategies ranked) and is ready to go. Otherwise, you will most likely be buying random stocks.

## 📑 Logging

- **system.log**: Tracks major events like API errors and MongoDB operations.
- **rank_system.log**: Logs all ranking-related events and updates.
